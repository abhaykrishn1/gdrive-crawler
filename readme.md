1. To access files programmatically, we need to use the Google Drive API. 
This requires setting up a project in the Google Cloud Console, enabling the Drive API, and obtaining the necessary credentials (OAuth 2.0 client ID or service account) for authentication.

2. Access Permissions:
Ensure that the files or folders you want to crawl are shared publicly. You can do this by right-clicking the file or folder in Google Drive, selecting "Share," and setting the sharing option to "Anyone with the link can view"

3. File Listing and Downloading:
The crawler should be designed to list files in the shared folder and filter them based on their MIME types (e.g., video files). The script should handle downloading these files using their unique file IDs, which can be obtained through the API

4.Handling Rate Limits:
Be aware of the Google Drive API's rate limits. If you are crawling a large number of files, implement exponential backoff or similar strategies to handle API limits.
